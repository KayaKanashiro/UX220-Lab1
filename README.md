## My favourite piece of writing.

My favourite piece of writing would have to be my "10 Years Ahead Plan." It was an exercise I completed in my first-year leadership class. The purpose of it was to help me visualize my ideal future and imagine myself living my dream life 10 years from now. I enjoyed it because it allowed me to set goals in the present and create a plan to achieve those goals in the future.
